# RTC-Real_Time_Clock-programming-using-MODBUS-Protocol
During my internship i was exposed to lot serial communication to PLC's like Smart Meters and so on, using the MODBUS protocol i was able to communicate to the Energy meter using a desktop application built using VB.

To know the working of the application, you need an energy meter(PLC) and a USB to SERIAL_PORT converter

Step 1 - Install the Visual Studio community version 2017
Step 2 - I have used VB to program the logic, you can also use c# or others
Step 3 - Extract the file RTC_USING_MODBUS and if the Visual Studio is already installed you can run the RTC_Modbus.SLN file
Step 4 - This desktop application will enable you to read and write the RTC parameter of the meter.
         please do some research before using the application
         I am open for suggestions and complaint, please write an email...GOOD DAY
